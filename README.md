Handwritten digit recognition using CNN and MNIST dataset

 # Handwritten Digit Recognition üß†‚úçÔ∏è

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

# About

- Used TensorFlow/Keras and trained a CNN with:
  - Conv2D layers
  - MaxPooling
  - Dense + Dropout
- Achieved ~98‚Äì99% test accuracy

#  Tools Used

- Python (in Google Colab)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib for visualization

# Results

- Accuracy: ~98.5%
- Sample predictions displayed using `matplotlib`

## Outcome

 Completed as part of Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha
